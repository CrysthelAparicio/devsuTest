Conclusion: Crysthel Aparicio

Performing this proof of concept was an  enriching  experience  that  allowed  me to explore

and validate the benefits of  test  automation. Implementing  scenarios  using  outlines  in

Cucumber gave us the flexibility to run multiple test variants with minimal code duplication.

This not only increased test coverage, but also made the development process more  efficient.

In addition, by integrating assertions and sad paths testing, we ensured that the application

not only works under ideal conditions, but also reacts appropriately to unexpected  inputs or

potential bugs. This proactive approach improves the resilience and robustness of the software.

A key aspect of this proof of concept was the application of Behavior Driven Development (BDD),

which allowed us to define the test scenarios in a natural language, facilitating collaboration

between developers, testers and stakeholders. This ensured that tests were aligned with business expectations.

We also implemented the Page Object Model to structure our tests in a way that made them more maintainable and

reusable, separating test logic from UI implementation details. This separation allowed us to apply Clean Code

principles, ensuring that our code is readable, organized and easy to maintain.

The creation of a dedicated development environment was crucial for testing consistency.  By isolating project

specific dependencies, we ensured that tests were reproducible and executed  consistently,   regardless of the

developer's environment.

The integration of Behave and Allure reporting libraries provided us with a powerful  tool  to visualize  test

status and results. The detailed and well-organized reports made it easy to identify bugs and provided a solid

foundation for informed decision making by the development team and stakeholders.

In conclusion, this proof of concept reaffirmed the importance of test automation in modern software development,

highlighting its ability to increase  efficiency  and  improve  product  quality.


I am grateful for the opportunity to have participated in this project.
