## Conclusions

The automation tests for the PetStore application have been successfully implemented using Cypress and Cucumber. 
These tests cover a range of scenarios, including adding a pet, finding a pet by ID, updating a pet, and searching for pets by status.

Using Cucumber ensures that the tests are readable and maintainable, while Cypress provides a robust testing framework.

- During the automation testing process, an issue with ID generation was discovered. Specifically, when the ID value in the request body was set to zero, the ID in the response remained unchanged.

- No sad path scenarios were implemented for the GET /find by status endpoint because When queried with a non-existent or empty status, the response consistently returned a 200 OK status.
