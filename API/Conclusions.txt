# Conclusions

1. The API tests for the PetStore application have been successfully implemented using Cypress and Cucumber.
2. The tests cover various scenarios such as adding a pet, finding a pet by ID, updating a pet, and finding pets by status.
3. The use of Cucumber ensures that the tests are readable and maintainable, while Cypress provides a powerful testing framework.

4. **Issue with ID Generation:**
   During the testing process, an issue was encountered with ID generation. Specifically, the ID did not change in the response when the ID value was set to zero in the request body. This discrepancy impacts the accuracy of the tests and needs to be addressed to ensure that unique IDs are correctly assigned and reflected in the response.

5. **Absence of Sad Path for Status Code:**
   It was observed that no sad path was implemented for scenarios involving status code checks. When querying with a non-existent or empty status, the response consistently returned a 200 OK status. This behavior may lead to confusion and does not accurately represent error handling for invalid or missing status values. Implementing proper sad path scenarios and handling for various status codes will enhance the robustness of the tests.
